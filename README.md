# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

Developed in collaboration with UNP, the Company Financials Dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of the organization's financial performance, encompassing revenue, profitability, and cost management. It provides a detailed overview of total sales, gross and net profit, and key financial metrics across various business segments.  

The dashboard tracks revenue trends over time, identifies top-performing products, and assesses the impact of discounts on sales performance. Additionally, it includes a cost breakdown, pinpointing areas for expense optimization. Key insights such as year-over-year growth, profit margins, and financial health indicators enable data-driven decision-making.  

By leveraging these insights, businesses can enhance profitability, streamline financial strategies, and drive sustainableÂ growth.
